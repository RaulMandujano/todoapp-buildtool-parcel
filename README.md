# BuildToolAssignment

Javascript build tools and bundlers are an important part of the web developers' tool kit. These tools allow the developer to take their code and prepare it for production. In this assignment, we will take a simple app, build it, and deploy it to production with 2 tools. First with Webpack and second with a bundler of your choice.

Requirements:

Build a quick todo app with the following requirements:
* You may use any framework you would like, but you cannot use the frameworks starter tools. IE create-react-app, Vue CLI, or Digit, you must develop from scratch. Failure to do so will result in a 0 for the assignment.
    * If you do use a framework other than Vanilla.js you need to show a commit with only the basic files in place (no build pipelines) before you start coding.
* Display todos
* Add todos
* Edit todos
* Complete todos
* Clear Completed todos
* Keep the structure in the starter repo
* In addition to the basic JS, functionality requirements please also ensure your todo app has the following:
    * At least 1 CSS file (SCSS or smimlar is fine but you will need to configure the build tool to account for this)
    * At least 1 Image
    * Use at least one ¬†js module
        * This could be Underscore.js or you could make your own module(s) or both üòÅ
* Once you have built your todo app, you will need to use webpack and one other bundler of your choice to build a production version of your app.
* To use 2 different bundlers, fork your own repo on GitHub to maintain your commit history.
* Both apps should have a dist folder where the production version of your app is distributed.
* Both should be hosted live
* With the submission, tell me why you picked the second tool?
* Turn in links to both live sites and both github repos
